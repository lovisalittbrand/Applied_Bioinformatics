BASH PIPELINE

THIS PIPELINE IS NOT FINISHED!!!!

The bash pipeline is contained in file ”bash_pipeline.sh”. It is run by the following command:
$ sh bash_pipeline.sh

Within the file you specify the arCOG-files you would like to analyze (cogs), they should be located in the data-folder. When running the pipeline all the necessary files and folders will be created in /data.

As the pipeline performs a concatenation, at least two arCOGs should be specified. 

Work to be done: 
- connect it to script calculating and visualizing phylogenetic signal. To do this one must have two different sets of data with differing tree-constraints.
