Host:    Lovisas-dator.local (AVX2, FMA3, 8 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s data/4_linebreak_iqtree/concatenation.lb.fasta -spp data/4_linebreak_iqtree/partition.nexus -st AA -wsl -nt 1 -pre T2_ML -g data/partition.nexus.treefile
Seed:    124708 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Tue Nov 17 14:00:21 2020
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (4 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 4 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
