IQ-TREE multicore version 2.0.3 for Mac OS X 64-bit built Apr 26 2020
Developed by Bui Quang Minh, Nguyen Lam Tung, Olga Chernomor,
Heiko Schmidt, Dominik Schrempf, Michael Woodhams.

Host:    Lovisas-dator (AVX2, FMA3, 8 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s data/3_concatenation_iqtree/concatenation.fasta -spp data/3_concatenation_iqtree/partition.nexus -st AA -wsl -nt 1 -pre T2_ML -g data/T2_constraint.treefile -m JTT+R3
Seed:    561255 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Fri Nov 27 15:40:20 2020
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (4 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 4 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
