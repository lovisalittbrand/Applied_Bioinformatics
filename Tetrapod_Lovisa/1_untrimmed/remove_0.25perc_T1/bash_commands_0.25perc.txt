Analysis: investigating break point of topology switch

1. Removing 0.25% of sites favoring T1 (0.0025)
python3 site_remover.py concatenation.fasta sites_to_remove_0.25perc.txt concat_0.25perc -pf partition.nexus 

new concatenation: concat_0.25perc.fasta
new partition: concat_0.25perc_partition.nexus


The following run were made with Iqtree:
- Unconstrained run
iqtree -s concat_0.25perc.fasta -st "AA" -wsl -nt 1 -pre unconstrained -m JTT+R3
