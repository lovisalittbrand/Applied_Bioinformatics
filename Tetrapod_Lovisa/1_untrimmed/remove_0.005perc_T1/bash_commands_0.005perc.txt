Analysis: investigating break point of topology switch

1. Removing 50% of the sites sites favoring T1 with signal > 0.5
python3 site_remover.py concatenation.fasta sites_to_remove_0.5signal.txt concat_0.5_0.5signal -pf partition.nexus 

new concatenation: concat_0.5signal.fasta
new partition: concat_0.5signal_partition.nexus


The following run were made with Iqtree:
- Unconstrained run
iqtree -s concat_0.5_0.5signal.fasta -st "AA" -wsl -nt 1 -pre unconstrained -m JTT+R3
