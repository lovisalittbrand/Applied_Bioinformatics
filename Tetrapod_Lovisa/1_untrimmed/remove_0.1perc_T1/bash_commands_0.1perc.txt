Analysis: investigating break point of topology switch

1. Removing 0.1% percentage (0.001) of the total number of sites favoring T1
python3 site_remover.py concatenation.fasta sites_to_remove_0.1perc.txt concat_0.1perc -pf partition.nexus 

new concatenation: concat_0.1perc.fasta
new partition: concat_0.1perc_partition.nexus


The following run were made with Iqtree:
- Unconstrained run
iqtree -s concat_0.1perc.fasta -st "AA" -wsl -nt 1 -pre unconstrained -m JTT+R3
