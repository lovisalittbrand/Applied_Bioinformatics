Analysis: investigating break point of topology switch

1. Removing 5 percentage of the sites favoring T1 to see if it changed the topology.

new concatenation: concat_rm_5perc.fasta
new partition: concat_rm_5perc_partition.nexus


The following run were made with Iqtree:
- Unconstrained run
iqtree -s concat_rm_5perc.fasta -st "AA" -wsl -nt 1 -pre unconstrained -m JTT+R3

Changed the topology!! T1 -> T2
