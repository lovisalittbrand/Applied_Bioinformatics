This folder contains scripts for a pipeline made in Snakemake. However, it is not finished and due to limitations with the snakelike framework a bash pipeline has been created instead.

A snakemake pipeline is contained in a Snakefile which contains a set of rules that are connected through their input-output. In run_pipeline.sh you can see how the pipeline can be executed in different ways, depending on what parts of the pipeline you want to execute.

NOTE: the paths to different folders may not be correct in all snakefiles, as they have been changed when experimenting with the framework.
