Analysis:  Creating concatenation and running Iqtree

Concatenation was performed the following way:
perl catfasta2phyml_mod.pl -c -f -v *_cat.fasta > concatenation.fasta 2> partition.nexus

RUNS IQTREE
___________

The following runs were made with Iqtree:
1. Unconstrained
iqtree -s concatenation.fasta -st "AA" -wsl -nt 1 -pre T1_ML -m JTT+R3

2. Constrained
Constraint topology: T2.treefile
iqtree -wsl -nt 1 -st "AA" -s concatenation.fasta -m JTT+R3 -g T2.treefile -pre T2_ML
