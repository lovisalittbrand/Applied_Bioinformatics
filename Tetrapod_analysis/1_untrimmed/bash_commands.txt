Analysis: Aligning files

The FASTA-sequences contained in 0_raw_data was aligned with MAFFT in the following way:
for i in *.fa; do mafft --auto $i > ${i%.fasta}.mafft.fasta ; done

To ensure that the files are ready for concatenation the names in FASTA-header must be mapped to unique taxa name. This is done in the following way:
for i in *.mafft.fasta; do awk -F"_" '{if($0 ~ /^>/) print $1"_"$2"_"$3; else print $0}' $i > ${i%.fa.mafft.fasta}_aln.fasta; done

Thereafter, the files are ready for concatenation -> results can be found in /original_conatenation.
